Dear Technical University Of Munich Admissions Committee,

I have known Sagnik Sarkar for the past two years when he started working as a RPA Developer in my project. 
I believe Sagnik will be an excellent addition to Technical University of Munich.

While working as a developer in RPA, he has always challenged himself with the opportunities provided to him. 
He is very confident and passionate towards his responsibilities and always gives 100% effort to the tasks assigned to him. 
He was initially appointed as a developer and gradually he was given opportunity to handle the project(handling call with the client, gathering requirement etc).
